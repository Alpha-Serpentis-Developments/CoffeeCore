## Hello World (hello/HelloWorld.java)
This program implements `BotCommand<MessageEmbed>`, `BotCommand<String>`, and `ButtonCommand<MessageEmbed>` showing
the basic functionality of Coffee Core.

By default, it also adds three of the default commands:
- `help` - Shows a list of commands
- `about` - Shows information about the bot
- `settings` - Configure the bot for the server
- `shutdown` - Shuts down the bot
